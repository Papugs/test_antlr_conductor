Term Project Details
One- to three-person teams are allowed but the expectations will be higher for three-person teams
Choose a partner in your lab group and choose between a “standard” project below and the self-proposed project option.
Deadline for forming groups and proposing projects: Monday 17/2
General requirement: all projects need to have a good specification, ideally based on a semantic framework. When a semantic framework is not appropriate, a thorough informal specification needs to be developed.
Standard Project: Virtual machine implementation for Rust
The Rust project applies the notion of a virtual machine with low-level memory management (Module 5) to the language Rust. Baseline expectations:

Web-based implementation based on Source Academy frontend (see GitHubLinks to an external site.)
Implementation of a sublanguage of Rust, consistent with a recent language documentation
Sequential language constructs: variable and function declarations, blocks, conditionals statements and expressions, while loops
Ownership handling: borrow checking done at compile time, as part of a type checker (Module 6)
Implementation should use a virtual machine
Implementation must use a low-level memory model, and all runtime data structures need to be allocated from a single ArrayBuffer.
Optional components:
visualization of ownership
reference counting (Rc)
concurrency

Self-proposed term projects
You need to propose the project using this form: https://forms.gle/VHHGeSut3Zb84KNJALinks to an external site.  

Project Outline
The first deliverable is the project outline, details to be announced.

Project Presentation
You will present your project in Week 13 to the instructor and/or TA. Your presentation is graded. The presentation will be limited to 20 minutes (without interruption), followed by at most 5 minutes of Questions and Answers. The presentation should:

give an overview of the project objectives (baseline and reach goals),
give a clear specification of at least one of the baseline objectives (the specification can be formal, in the style of rules or BNF, for example, or informal)
describe to what extent the objectives have been met (and if it's work-in-progress: will be met)
highlight the implementation techniques used to achieve the objectives,
discuss the project outcome and/or limitations and/or possible future work and/or applications
Each team member needs to be speaking for at least 5 minutes. You can use slides, or demos, or other visual aids. The presentation will be recorded for grading purposes.

Project Report
You are expected to submit the project report on Friday Week 13 at midnight, using the folder Project Report. The report needs to include the following information on the first page:

Names and student numbers of all team members
Project title
URL of all repositories that are needed to build the system
The report should cover the following topics:

Outline of the scope and objectives of the project, including T-diagrams of all major language processing steps that the project utilizes and including a description of the language give a clear specification of at least one of the baseline objectives (the specification can be formal, in the style of rules or BNF, for example, or informal)
Clear specification of the envisioned deliverable (informal or formal)
Description to what extent the objectives are met
Description of how the system can be built using the repository (or repositories)
Description of test cases and how to run them: Make sure you include at least 10 test cases that cover the main features of the system
Project sources: GitHub repositories that contain all software that is needed to run your language implementation, with clear instructions how to build and run the software
Source Academy integration
The standard project (and possibly some self-proposed projects) require Source Academy integration. We will give you some support and scaffolding for Source Academy integration, stay tuned.  

Parser support
Typically, CS4215 projects require a parser, and parsers are not a core topic covered in the course. We will give you some support for parsing, stay tuned.
